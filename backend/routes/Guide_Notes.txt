CONNECTION NOTES : 


MIDDLEWARE : The middleware in node.js is a function that will have 
             all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, 
             and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.
              
              A request handler with access to the application's request-response cycle is known as middleware. 
              It's a function that holds the request object, the response object, and the middleware function. 
              Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request.
